# Sudoku Solver

https://nickknapton12.github.io/Sudoku-Solver-Visualizer/

Welcome to my Sudoku solver! I built this based off my C++ Sudoku solver I had already built, but much better. The classic Sudoku game involves a grid of 81 squares. The grid is divided into nine blocks, each containing nine squares. The rules of the game are simple: each of the nine blocks has to contain all the numbers 1-9 within its squares. Each number can only appear once in a row, column or box. 

It is still in very early stage, it works, but isnt pretty. It still needs to be styled to look nice and needs a few more things mentioned below. I plan to get to these if I have free time inbetween studying for finals in university, or during winter break.

## How to use

Simply input puzzle into the grid displayed and press the solve button!

## Algorithm

I am currently only using a backtracking algorithm to solve puzzles inputted, this algorithm is considered a brute force algorithm and more can be read on backtracking [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Backtracking). I have plans to add more commonly used algorithms in the future, as listed below.

## Future Plans

- Add additional algorithms to solve puzzle
- Add some sort of short tutorial for users who have never visited the site
