# Sudoku Solver

https://nickknapton12.github.io/Sudoku-Solver-Visualizer/

Welcome to my Sudoku solver! I built this based off my C++ Sudoku solver I had already built, but much better. The classic Sudoku game involves a grid of 81 squares. The grid is divided into nine blocks, each containing nine squares. The rules of the game are simple: each of the nine blocks has to contain all the numbers 1-9 within its squares. Each number can only appear once in a row, column or box. 

## How to use

Simply input puzzle into the grid displayed, set solve speed (fast is recommended) and press the solve button! Alternatively use an example puzzle by pressing the 'example puzzle' button.

## Algorithm

I am currently only using a backtracking algorithm to solve puzzles inputted, this algorithm is considered a brute force algorithm and more can be read on backtracking [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Backtracking). I have plans to add more commonly used algorithms in the future, as listed below.

## Future Plans

- Add additional algorithms to solve puzzle
- Make more responsive
